# This file provides stable entity IDs for various components, in order to be used in the HTTP API.

# ESPHome derives entity IDs (internally called "object IDs") from the component name, which is
# used as the ID in the HTTP API endpoints. Unfortunately there is no way to control them so they
# are set independently of the name, so this is a weird workaround for that.
